# Bevy Terrain Preprocess

A preprocessing tool for the [Bevy Terrain](https://github.com/kurtkuehnert/bevy_terrain) library.

The bevy terrain library makes use of a quite specific terrain data format.
To use the library, you have to convert your geodata, heightmaps, etc. to the format expected by bevy terrain.
To make this as simple as possible this library provides a CLI, that is build using the [GDAL](https://gdal.org) geodata
translator library.
